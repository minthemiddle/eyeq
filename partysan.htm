         Partysan hello <p>Interview with Paul van Dyk: <br> Paul van Dyk i spretty stre ed, the entire world want sthe Berlin DJ. Some of u swould be happy to travel through the countries, Paul visit a month. Thu she' sjetting from Germany to Israel, then through Ireland to the USA and at last to Scotland. "If I mi  a plane, everything will break down. Moreover Paul i sa frequently asked remixer, he' sworking on Faithle ' s"Bring my family back" and had succe  with hi sown release slike "For An Angel" <p>Partysan: You're pretty busy, what do you concrete like at traveling around? <br> Paul: Arriving, being there and the pre-joy of returning home, but I hate the boring waiting in the plane or <br> at the airport. <br> Partysan: Since when you're turning the table sand what about your first time? <br> Paul: Since 1991 at the Tresor. My first time wa smy second time with Technics, at home I just had a&nbsp; Dual turntable, where you had to justifier (?) the speed with a small wheel; and then the difference of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Boxes! The power of the Bose-system could really make you fear! Being DJ at the Tresor was&nbsp;completely different then just playing in bedroom. <br> Partysan: Did you have any model sin former time sand what about now? <br> Paul: Mmh, the music I liked wa snot very popular in Germany, but Ron Ellen wa svery useable for me and what DJ Rok did '91 and '92 I liked very much. Now I actual do not have any models, but when Nick Warren i srocking the tables, I'm jumping on the dancefloor! <br> Partysan: You've been to countrie slike Singapur, Australia, Mexico and USA, how did you do, do the clubber sdiffer? <br> Paul: The first time in the USA wa sreally difficult, but now the people know me and they expect f.e. in the Twilo in New York the stuff from me, which I do offer. In Germany you just listen to music a sa background or in your favorite movie, there are only a few, who care about more intensive. Since two, three years, everything stagnate in the Off Beat jungle. But in England the music i smore important, the people have a property, to receive thing sand to use them for their use. <br> Partysan: Where do you prefer to turn tables? <br> Paul: In Berlin, my girlfriend and my friend sare there. And I don't have to go to hotel after the gig! In foreign countrie sI loved Mexico, when I had been there for the first time, I believed there just would be sandy ways.! But there' salso pretty much industry and like in other countries, where the sun shine sa lot, that influence sthe mood of the people very positive. You notice, that we had a bad year in Germany. <br> Partysan: But in England, the people should have an even worse mood?! <br> Paul: No, everything there i  o fucking, they really need to have a lot of parties. <br> Partysan: Your new album won't appear on MFS, what are the reasons?? <br> Paul: MF si sa small creativcell, I got on the peak of opportunities. <p>Thanx,&nbsp; (Text MC Ursel) <p>(from the Partysan magazine, translated into English) <br> (My opinion: Paul used a lot of emotional expre ions, thu sit wa svery difficult to translate it! I'm sorry!) </td>
