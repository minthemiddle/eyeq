          <p>he is the 
            only dj in the world who is able to blend himself and his crowd on 
            the dancefloor into this all for one, one for all feeling. this quote 
            from the about frankfurt essays of Localizer 1.0 epitomizes sven väth's 
            special status in the world of electronic music and the party culture 
            that goes with it. to tell his story means to tell the story of dance 
            music and it s development since the mid 80ies. In the beginning it 
            was just a typical frankfurt thing, though...in 
            the early 80ies, young sven learned the dj trade the old way in the 
            two hippest frankfurt clubs, the vogue and the dorian gray. during 
            this phase of nightlife - which seems almost reactionary compared 
            to now his subversive potential started to show. his open narcissism 
            and the urge to dress up in disguise soon made him one of frankfurt's 
            most bizarre birds of paradisefrom 
            the middle of the 80ies on, as a dj, he began to move away from the 
            mainstream. he started to develop his own style which was partly influenced 
            by the new romantic movement, where he had his roots, and wave. but 
            soon imports from the us dance underground an early american house 
            music became more and more important for him.the 
            world-wide success of the project off and the charts single electric 
            salsa which he had produced together with his producers of the time 
            michael münzing an dluca anzelotti (later snap) in 1986, even turned 
            sven into a real pop star of the teenie press for a while. He was 
            the ideal of the exploding music an d club scene in the entire rhein-main 
            area. there was hardly a dj who didn't worship him and hardly any 
            dance project that wasn't influenced by him. electronic 
            body music (EBM) washed over germany in 1987, followed by acid house 
            wave in 1988. sven väth was always the very first one to take in the 
            new music and transfer it to the dancefloor in his own way. the old 
            vogue which he re-opened together with his partners münzing and martinsohn 
            under the promising name of omen, was his platform. the omen turned 
            out to be one of the most important chapters of german club history 
            it still is, in spite of never-ending rumors about the place closing 
            down.in 
            1989, sven cancelled his off-image and together with matthias hoffmann 
            and steffen britzke aka stevie b zet he started the project mosaic. 
            as mosaic, the trio released a number of successive club hits and 
            remixes until the end of 1990.and 
            again, sven was the first to be there when techno swept over germany 
            in the summer of 1990. in the course of the rapid development of the 
            dj and event culture during the years of 1990 and 1991, he spread 
            the news about the new music thoughout the country. soon he belonged 
            to the very few who were booked to dj abroad.</p>
