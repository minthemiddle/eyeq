          <p><em>Note: The infos here are taken from interviews and reports with 
            and about Sven I've seen on TV and read in magazines, from the official 
            biography published on the <a href="http://www.sven-vaeth.de">Official 
            Sven Väth Page</a>, and finally from miscellaneous information bits 
            reached through various medias the way to me.</em></p>
          <p>Sven Väth is a well-known DJ from Frankfurt / Main, Germany. He was 
            born on the 26th of October 1964 in Offenbach and grown up in Obertshausen 
            both near Frankfurt. After finishing school he did an apprenticeship 
            as a building fitter. At the age of 18 he got a chance to DJ at &quot;<b>Dorian 
            Gray</b>&quot;, a big and well-known club in Frankfurt.</p>
          <p>Then later in the 80s Sven became the frontman of a group called 
            &quot;<b>Off</b>&quot;. He formed it with <b>Michael 
            Münzig</b> and <b>Luca Anzilotti</b>, who later became 
            <b>Snap</b>, and were previously known as &quot;<b>16 
            Bit</b>&quot; (Sven was also involved in at least one '16 Bit' 
            production). <b>Matthias Hoffmann</b> (aka AC Boutsen) joined 
            Off later. <br>
            Their biggest hit was 1987 &quot;Electrica Salsa (Baba Baba)&quot;. 
            I don't like the Off stuff, be warned, Sven's 'singing' is terrible 
            - in my opinion, of course :-) </p>
          <p>In 1988 he opened a club called &quot;<b>Omen</b>&quot; 
            together with Michael Münzig and Mathias Martinsohn. It was one of 
            Frankfurt's biggest and most famous clubs. After 10 years it closed 
            in autumn 1998.</p>
          <p> In 1989, Sven cancelled his Off-image and together with Matthias 
            Hoffmann (aka AC Boutsen) and Steffen Britzke (aka Stevie B-Zet) he 
            started the project <b>Mosaic</b>. As Mosaic, the trio released 
            a number of successive club hits and remixes until the end of 1990. 
          </p>
          <p>Between summer 1991 and spring 1992, he founded the label &quot;<b>EYE-Q</b>&quot; 
            together with his manager <b>Heinz Roth</b> and <b>Matthias 
            Hoffmann</b>. It was divided into the two sublabels &quot;<b>HARTHOUSE</b>&quot; 
            (for a techno/house style) and &quot;<b>RECYCLE OR DIE</b>&quot; 
            (featuring electronic instrumental/experimental/ambient music) and 
            the the &quot;<b>EYE-Q Main Label</b>&quot; (for everything 
            that doesn't fit into the other catagories).</p>
          <p> At the end of 1992, Sven met up with <b>Ralf Hildenbeutel</b>, 
            who from then on would never move from his side behind the mixing 
            tables. Together with ralf, he produced the first album under his 
            own name, <a href="svssdisc.htm#Accident">Accident In Paradise</a>. 
            The first single release, <a href="svssdisc.htm#Lesperanza">L'esperanza</a>, 
            charted in 1993. As a consequence, Eye Q and HARTHOUSE got their first 
            major deal. At the end of 1993, the second album called <a href="svssdisc.htm#HarlequinRobotBallet">The 
            Harlequin, The Robot And The Ballet-Dancer</a> was released. It was 
            Svens's very own combination of techno, trance and house influences 
            with classical elements. <a href="svssdisc.htm#Touch">Touch Themes 
            Of Harlequin - Robot - Ballet-Dancer</a>, the pertinent remix album 
            with interpretations by Underworld, Speedy j., David Holmes and Hardfloor 
            among others, was released one year later. In the same year, an album 
            of Väth's side project Astral Pilot, <a href="svssdisc.htm#Acupuncture">Electro 
            Acupuncture</a>, where he and Stevie B-Zet lives out their harder 
            club sides, appeared on Harthouse. </p>
          <p> 1995 turned out to be the year of major personal changes for Sven. 
            The first lasting relationship with a woman made him quiet down a 
            bit after all these long years of sex, drugs &amp; techno. He changed 
            his look and began to prepare his costly and ambitious event project 
            turned into a financial disaster which forced sven to freeze the project 
            for the time being. Personally, though, Sven jumped the next hurdle. 
            Together with Stevie B-Zet, he produced the soundtrack of the thriller 
            <a href="svssdisc.htm#KalteFinger">The Cold Finger</a> which opened 
            in may throughout German movie theatre's. </p>
          <p>In early 1997 the changes climaxed. Sven separated from his business 
            partners and left EYE-Q. Around June '97 after moving to Berlin the 
            German label wasn't able to pay their bills and filed a petitition 
            for bankruptcy. I've heard that just before that, they've renamend 
            themselves &quot;Cheyenne&quot;, probably to keep the names EYE-Q/HARTHOUSE/ROD 
            'clean' during the bankruptcy proceedings.<br>
            EYE-Q UK is still alive and releasing new records, but this has nothing 
            to do with Sven and the 'good old days'. At the end of '97 the rights 
            on the name HARTHOUSE has been sold to <a href="http://www.ucmg.com/">UCMG 
            (Undercover Music Group)</a>. In February '98 they released a Retrospective 
            HH compilation.</p>
          <p> Sven, on his own, moved to a new Frankfurt office and started the 
            first german booking agency named <b>Cocoon Booking</b> 
            which is considered one of the most important in the country by now. 
          </p>
          <p>In January 1998, Sven's new album '<a href="svssdisc.htm#Fusion">Fusion</a>' 
            has been released on Virgin Records. The album's title track 'Fusion' 
            is as the name already says a sound concoction of various influences. 
            Trip Hop, Electro and Big Beat are poured together, spiced up with 
            some Soundtrack Music and other orchestral elements. 'Scorpio's Movement' 
            is a rather gloomy, mysterious techno track. Here, Sven for the first 
            time consequently creates the sounds he has promoted as a DJ for years. 
            Looking at all these various elements, it is not all self-evident 
            that the new album is indeed again a typical and distinct Sven Väth 
            piece of work. If you listen closely, you will realize that on a number 
            of tracks he has the translated consciously or unconsciously - the 
            sound of frankfurt into the sounds of the late 90ies. He can't escape 
            himself. The moods created are something like old acquaintances which 
            is good. Isn't there anything more valuable to any artist than being 
            recognized in any he does?! <br>
            So, on Fusion, too, driving beats and spherical sounds are arranged 
            in the typical Väth wild pitch style to create the desired atmospheres. 
            The touch of worldmusic that one hears in a lot of what Sven Väth 
            and Ralf Hildenbeutel have written stems from certain influences as 
            e.g. grom musicians such as Joe Mubare or Peter Gabriel. Many times 
            the tracks remind of soundtracks or they could very well be used as 
            such. they are not really tracks but songs that tell stories. It's 
            part of Sven Väth's nature that these songs tend to be a bit bombastic 
            at times it's as if Trevor Horn had been there looking over Svens's 
            and Ralf's shoulders. </p>
          <p align="center"> --- </p>
          <p>Since 1992 Sven Väth has been collaborating with <b>Ralf Hildenbeutel</b>. 
            They've worked on the projects &quot;<b>Essence of Nature</b>&quot; 
            and &quot;<b>Barbarella</b>&quot;, and they've also done 
            Sven's 'solo' releases together.<br>
            Ralf Hildenbeutel has also released some work without Sven, as &quot;<b>Ralf 
            Hildenbeutel</b>&quot;, &quot;<b>Earth Nation</b>&quot;, 
            &quot;<b>Curare</b>&quot;, &quot;<b>Progressive Attack</b>&quot;, 
            &quot;<b>Cygnus X</b>&quot; and &quot;<b>Odysee of 
            Noises</b>&quot;. A list of this work can be found in my <a href="hildenbeutel.htm">Unofficial 
            Ralf Hildenbeutel Discography</a>.</p>
          <p>&quot;<b>Metal Master</b>&quot; is a collaboration between 
            Sven Väth and <b>A.C. Boutsen</b> (aka Matthias Hoffmann).</p>
          <p>&quot;<b>Astral Pilot</b>&quot; is a collaboration of Sven 
            Väth and <b>Stevie B-Zet</b> (aka Steffen Britzke). Together 
            they've also made the soundtrack for a film called &quot;<b>Der 
            Kalte Finger</b>&quot;. A list of this work can be found in my 
            <a href="bzet.htm">Unofficial Stevie B-Zet Discography</a>.</p>
